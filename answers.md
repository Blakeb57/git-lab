Q4. The output lists my untracked/modified files that are not yet staged for commit, the files being README.md amd amswers.md. It also tells me how to push the files to     be staged for commit.
Q5. The output states that the README.md file has now been staged under the "Changes to be committed:" section and the text is green. While keeping the answers.md           under the untracked files section that is not yet been staged for commit and is in a red text.
Q6. After adding the answers.md file it has now become groupd with the README.md file that is now listed under the changes to be committed section. Both of the files        are now in a green text as well.
Q7. After inputing the git-commit -m command the terminal states: 2 files changed, 3 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-). The terminal also state that my branch master is         ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit and to use git push to publish my local commits.
