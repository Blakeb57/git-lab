the output put the README.md file as mew file and under the changes to be committed section while keeping the answers.md under the untracked files section
after adding the answers.md file it has now become groupd with the README.md file listed as new file and under the changes to be committed section
after listing the command again I got back On branch master changes not staged for commit: modified answers.md
